# PROJECT TASKS (Mandatory and Advanced)


# @MANDATORY_TASKS (From Task 0 to 10)


# N0. 0. Run Python file
  * 0-run
    * Write a shell script that runs a Python script.
      * The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

# No. 1. Run inline
  * 1-run_inline
    * Write a shell script that runs Python code.
      * The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

# No. 2. Hello, print
  * 2-print.py
    * Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
      * Use the function print

# No. 3. Print integer
  * 3-print_number.py
    * Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
    
# No. 4. Print float
  * 4-print_float.py
    * Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

# No. 5. Print string
  * 5-print_string.py
    * Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

# No. 6. Play with strings
  * 6-concat.py
    * Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!

# No. 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
  * 7-edges.py
    * Complete this source code

# No. 8. Create a new sentence

# No. 9. Easter Egg
  * 9-easter_egg.py
    * Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
      * Your script should be maximum 98 characters long 
        * (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

# No. 10. Linked list cycle
  * 10-check_cycle.c
    * Technical interview preparation:
      * You are not allowed to google anything
      * This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.

    * Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
      * Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
      * Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

    * Requirements:
      * Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free


# @Advanced_Tasks (From Task 6 to 16)

# No. 11. Hello, write

  * 101-compile
    * Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

# No. 13. ByteCode -> Python #1
  * 102-magic_calculation.py
    * Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode.
